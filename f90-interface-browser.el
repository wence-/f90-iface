;;; Commentary:
;; You write (or work on) large, modern fortran code bases.  These
;; make heavy use of function overloading and generic interfaces.  Your
;; brain is too small to remember what all the specialisers are
;; called.  Therefore, your editor should help you.

;; Load this file and tell it to parse all the fortran files in your
;; code base.  You can do this one directory at a time by calling
;; `f90-parse-interfaces-in-dir' (M-x f90-parse-interfaces-in-dir
;; RET).  Or you can parse all the fortran files in a directory and
;; recursively in its subdirectories by calling
;; `f90-parse-all-interfaces'.

;; Now you are able to browse (with completion) all defined interfaces
;; in your code by calling `f90-browse-interface-specialisers'.
;; Alternatively, if `point' is on a function or subroutine call, you
;; can call `f90-find-tag-interface' and you'll be shown a list of the
;; interfaces that match the (possibly typed) argument list of the
;; current function.  This latter hooks into the `find-tag' machinery
;; so that you can use it on the M-. keybinding and it will fall back
;; to completing tag names if you don't want to look for an interface
;; definition.

;; Derived types are also parsed, so that slot types of derived types
;; are given the correct type (rather than a UNION-TYPE) when arglist
;; matching.  You can show the definition of a know derived type by
;; calling `f90-show-type-definition' which prompts (with completion)
;; for a typename to show.

;; The parsing is by no means complete, it does a half-hearted attempt
;; using regular expressions (now you have two problems) rather than
;; defining a grammar and doing full parsing.
